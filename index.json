My research aims to explore design possibilities to improve multilingual communication based on grounded understandings of how people consume and make sense of foreign language messages and contents.\nStudy 1: Understanding how people consume and make sense of foreign language messages To investigate how language affects people’s attention to and engagement with social media posts, I conducted an eye-tracking lab study in which monolingual English speaking participants (N=22) viewed a mock newsfeed containing English and foreign language posts. The result showed that participants paid less attention to, and showed less willingness to engage with, foreign language posts compared to English posts.\nI also conducted a qualitative interview study examining participants’ actual Facebook timelines (N=23) and probing the reasons that people were reluctant to pay attention to and engage with foreign language posts. Interviewees reported that they felt a lack of relevance and cultural knowledge when they tried to understand foreign language posts. Even with MT results, literal translation often could not provide sufficient understanding of posts due to the imperfect quality of MT and people’s lack of contextual knowledge associated with each post. As a strategy to make sense of foreign language posts, some focused on simply extracting the emotional components of a post (e.g., emoji) while others tried to gain a fuller understanding of a post by searching the information about keywords.

Aligned with the sensemaking strategies that interview participants reported (i.e., emotion vs. context focus), SenseTrans provided emotional knowledge about a poster’s emotional states and contextual knowledge about the social and physical context of a post. By making use of available NLP techniques such as sentiment mining and named entity extraction, SenseTrans provides auto generated emotional and contextual annotations based on the text content of a status update.\nRelated Publications  Hajin Lim, Dan Cosley, and Susan R.

Also, we performed an evaluation study that showed the possibilities of Ubi-jector to facilitate an effective information sharing and foster an active participation even in poorly-equipped environments.","tags":null,"title":"Ubi-jector: an information-sharing workspace in casual places using mobile devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hajin Lim","Seohee Choi","Joonhwan Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1357016400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1357016400,"objectID":"66ca8707fc74b6c18926e1c7fe993bb8","permalink":"https://hajinlim.github.io/publication/lim-2013-ubi/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lim-2013-ubi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Ubi-jector: an information-sharing screen in a casual meeting environment using mobile devices","type":"publication"}]
